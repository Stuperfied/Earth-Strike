# Earth-Strike

Purpose:
Many of the issues raised within Earth-Strike have historically exist within either the discord servers or loomio where they quickly fall from public view and are forgotten. This negates both further discussion and realisation by other members which can result in the issue being raised multiple times to no end.

This document exists to provide a platform for issues raised by members of earth-strike to be listed for discussion in an effort to provide horrizontal inclusion and as an information bank to negate the rehashing of issues which have already been dealt with in the past. 

Deffinition:
  Issue- Anything requiring discussion relating to any topic directly associated to earth-strike.
 
Usage: Heirarchy of topics filed under main branches. Main branches could be International, National, Bilateral. Issues should be listed here before being raised for discussion in order to provide for the most inclusion. A link to the issue should be provided at the time of raising the issue. Points raised about an issue should be listed in the comments and any outcomes after a vote or other such process submitted to be merged. This repository should be listed on every platform members may use to seek out this information. Any members who have been provided links but express concerns about exclusion and indicate that they have not been monitoring these documents should be taken as self excluding.
