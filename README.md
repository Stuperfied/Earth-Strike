# Earth-Strike

Inspiration:
Many of the issues raised within Earth-Strike have historically exist within either the discord servers, loomio or google documents where they quickly fall from public view and are forgotten. This negates both further discussion and realisation by other members which can result in the issue being raised multiple times to no end. It was quickly apparent that other forms of electronic data also require storage as a resource and hence this repository has been created.


Purpose:
By accumulating information in one place, we can create a central archive as a resource that will benefit everyone. 

This repository exists as both a platform and an archive for issues raised by members of earth-strike and other electronic materials to be listed for discussion and reference in an effort to provide horrizontal inclusion, a resource for materials and as an information bank to negate the rehashing of issues which have already been dealt with in the past.

Note: Any electronic versions of any materials either related to or unrelated to issues may be stored here.


Deffinition:
  Issue- Anything requiring discussion relating to any topic directly associated to earth-strike.
 
Usage: Heirarchy of topics and documents filed under campaigns. Campaigns could be International, National, Bilateral etc and could be further subdivided into focus groups or teams. Previously created documents may also be merged in order to maintain our historical activity. Issues should be listed here before being raised for discussion in order to provide for the most inclusion. A link to the issue should be provided at the time of raising the issue. Points raised about an issue should be listed in the comments and any outcomes after a vote or other such process submitted to be merged. This repository should be listed on every platform members may use to seek out this information. Any members who have been provided links but express concerns about exclusion and indicate that they have not been monitoring these documents should be taken as self excluding.


How to:
There are many ways to use the system, the easiest way for those new to github to be involved is to create an issue which is easy and will in no way cause any problems. Don't be afraid as you can't break anything. You may also do what is called forking or cloning the repository which will create your own local copy which you can then edit directly in your own account. Any changes you make will not effect the master branch and after you have made your changes you can submit them for review and merger into the original repository by creating a pull request. For further information, there are extensive tutorials on google however others are encouraged to expand/edit this set of instructions.

Tip: When creating or uploading, place slashes '/' in the name section to specify directories.
